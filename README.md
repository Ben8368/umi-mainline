# umi-mainline

Running a mainline Linux kernel on the **Xiaomi Mi 10** (SM8250 / "kona",
device codename `umi`, model M2001J2C).

This is a working bring-up, not a plan: the kernel boots to userspace in about
12 seconds, drives the 1080×2340 command-mode AMOLED over DSC, dims it, turns
it off and back on, and reads the ST FTS touchscreen. Nothing here flashes a
partition — the kernel is always loaded into RAM with `fastboot boot`.

## Hardware

* SoC: Qualcomm SM8250 (Snapdragon 865), 8 cores
* Display: 1080×2340 AMOLED, command mode, DSC 8bpc/8bpp, slice 540×12
* Panel variant on the test device: `j2_mp_42_02_0b__dsc_cmd` (**CSOT / 华星光电**, vendor code `42`)
* Touch: **STMicroelectronics FTS** at `i2c@a94000` (QUPV3 wrap1 SE5), address
  `0x49`, reset GPIO38, IRQ GPIO39, level low
* Power: pm8150 / pm8150l / pm8150b / pm8009

The panel and the touch controller are both variants: the same phone shipped
with CSOT and Samsung panels and with Goodix GT9889 (address `0x5d`, on the
same I2C bus) as the touch alternative. The panel driver is data-driven from DT
so it covers every panel; the touch driver speaks the FTS protocol only.

## Build

Everything is built inside WSL (Alpine on ext4; building on a Windows mount is
painfully slow). One script does the whole job — driver installation, Kconfig
wiring, defconfig, config fragment merge, `make Image.gz dtbs`, and artifact
collection:

```sh
wsl -d umi -u root -e sh scripts/build.sh     # run from the repo root
```

Environment overrides: `TREE` (kernel tree, default `/root/linux`), `OUT`,
`WS`, `JOBS`, `TC=gcc|llvm`.

Requirements:
* a mainline kernel tree, 6.12 or newer, at `$TREE`
* `aarch64-none-elf-` GCC (or clang with `TC=llvm`)
* for `CONFIG_DRM_PANIC_SCREEN_QR_CODE`: a Rust toolchain plus `bindgen` and
  `libclang` (`scripts/install-rust.sh`)

Then pack an Android boot image (header v2, gzip kernel, DTB appended):

```sh
python tools/pack-umi.py --name p16-touch
```

## Boot it

```sh
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot devices
fastboot boot out/boot-umi-p16-touch.img
```

`fastboot boot` downloads the image into RAM and jumps to it. It does **not**
write to any partition, so the installed Android stays untouched — power-cycling
the phone returns to MIUI.

Two gotchas that cost days:

* **Only one `fastboot boot` per bootloader session.** A second one fails with
  `Failed to load/authenticate boot image`; run `fastboot reboot-bootloader`
  in between.
* **`fastboot boot` wants a compressed kernel.** ABL refuses an uncompressed
  `Image` and wants either gzip or `ARM\x64` at offset 56 of the kernel blob.

## Technical notes

The interesting part of this port is the list of things that silently fail.

**The bootloader resolves device-tree overlays by symbol.** ABL applies 29
overlay fragments on top of the base DTB and resolves every `&label` reference
through `__symbols__`. One missing label and the overlay set is dropped without
a single line of output. So the base DTB must be compiled with `dtc -@`, and
`dts/umi-dtbo-stubs.dtsi` adds 200+ placeholder labels that exist only to keep
the downstream overlays resolvable.

**The vendor DSI command format is not the mainline one.** Downstream
`qcom,mdss-dsi-on-command` is a byte stream of packets with a **7-byte header**
per packet:

```
dtype(1) last(1) vc(1) ack(1) wait(1) dlen(2, big endian)
```

`wait` is in **milliseconds** (the vendor driver calls
`usleep_range(wait * 1000, ...)`), and `last` is not a terminator — the vendor
driver ignores it and walks `dlen` instead. 32-bit cells inside `<...>` are
written one byte per cell, big-endian.

**DSC PPS is generated by the driver, not by the panel sequence.** The 652-byte
init sequence of this panel contains 59 packets and *none* of them is a PPS
packet, even though the panel runs DSC. The PPS has to be built from the DT
parameters with `drm_dsc_pps_payload_pack()` and sent with
`mipi_dsi_picture_parameter_set()`.

**No panel, no DPU.** `component_bind_all()` (which contains `dsi_bind()` and
needs a panel) runs *before* `msm_drm_kms_init()` → `dpu_kms_init()`. There is
no way to "test the DPU first and add the panel later": the panel node has to be
present before anything display-related initialises.

**Unclaimed regulators get switched off 42 seconds in.** `display_panel_vci` and
`touch_vddio_vreg` are enabled by the bootloader but have no consumer in Linux,
so `regulator_late_cleanup()` disables them mid-boot and the panel goes dark.
Booting with `regulator_ignore_unused` fixes it — the rails are left exactly as
the bootloader left them, nothing is reprogrammed.

**Brightness is not linear.** 400 out of 2047 is pure black, 1500 is comfortable
indoors. A "perfectly initialised panel" with brightness 400 looks exactly like
a broken one. This single number cost more debugging time than the whole DSI
link.

**The touch protocol is 8-byte events read one at a time.** Command `0x85`
returns one event; `0x00` in byte 0 means "FIFO empty". The class/object
encoding, the 12-bit coordinate packing and the fallback for the older flat
event codes are documented at the top of `patches/fts-umi.c`.

## Layout

`dump/`, `downstream-kernel/`, `rootfs/` and `out/` are working directories and

## License

This repository mixes licenses on purpose; `LICENSE` has the table and
`LICENSES/` the full texts.

* `patches/` — **GPL-2.0-only** (a driver cannot enter the kernel otherwise)
* `dts/` — **BSD-3-Clause** (same as the upstream Qualcomm device trees)
* `scripts/`, `tools/` — **CC0-1.0** (public domain, no attribution needed)
* `docs/`, this README — **CC-BY-4.0**

## Third-party material

The port was written by reading a vendor kernel and a vendor device tree that
were already present on the device. Those sources, the decompiled vendor DT and
any firmware images are **not** redistributed here; only the facts that matter
(register values, timings, GPIO numbers, protocol layout) are recorded, in
`docs/HARDWARE.md` and in the source comments.

No voltage, current or power limit is ever changed by this project. Regulators
are enabled and left at the value the bootloader programmed.
